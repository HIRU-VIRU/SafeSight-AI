## 1. Problem Statement

Construction sites are inherently hazardous environments where strict adherence to safety protocols is essential to prevent accidents, injuries, and fatalities. Among the most critical safety requirements are the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly safety helmets and harnesses for workers operating at height or in high-risk zones.

Despite the presence of safety regulations and on-site supervision, safety compliance monitoring in most construction sites is largely manual. Supervisors are expected to visually inspect workers and ensure compliance across large areas, multiple work zones, and numerous workers simultaneously. This manual approach is inconsistent, prone to human error, and difficult to sustain continuously throughout working hours.

As a result, safety violations such as workers not wearing helmets or harnesses often go unnoticed or are detected too late, leading to preventable accidents. According to global construction safety reports, a significant percentage of fatal and non-fatal workplace injuries are linked directly to the absence or improper use of protective equipment.

At the same time, many construction sites are already equipped with CCTV surveillance systems primarily used for security and monitoring purposes. However, these video feeds are rarely utilized for proactive safety enforcement and are typically reviewed only after an incident has occurred.

This project aims to address this gap by leveraging computer vision and artificial intelligence to automate safety compliance monitoring. The proposed system continuously analyzes live CCTV video feeds to detect workers and verify the presence of mandatory safety gear such as helmets and harnesses. When a violation is detected, the system automatically logs the incident and triggers an immediate alert to enable timely corrective action.

By replacing inconsistent manual monitoring with a real-time, automated detection system, the project seeks to improve safety enforcement reliability, reduce workplace accidents, and enhance overall construction site safety management.
